    "\n",
    "**Liquidity** is the ease of trading a security. This encompasses many factors, all of which impose a cost on those wishing to trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sources of Illiquidity\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several sources of illiquidity that contribute to trading costs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Exogenous transactions costs:** These are the most direct costs and include brokerage fees, order-processing costs, and transaction taxes.\n",
    "* **Demand pressure:** When you need to sell quickly, a natural buyer may not be immediately available. Whoever is available will likely ask to be compensated to absorb the trade, leading to a less favorable price.\n",
    "* **Inventory risk:** If you can’t find a buyer, you might sell to a market maker who will later sell the position. However, since the market maker faces the risk of future price changes, they will demand compensation for this risk.\n",
    "* **Private information:** This is the concern over trading against a more informed party (e.g., an insider). You need to be compensated for taking on this risk. Private information can be about fundamentals or about future order flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🤔 **Food for thought:** A perfect answer to the question of \"at what price can I trade?\" requires costly experimentation. It would require trading and measuring how prices change in response to your trading behavior."

    "\n",
    "* One very conservative way of looking at it is to look at the **maximum** of this statistic across stocks. This tells you the \"weakest\" link in your portfolio formation.

    "Congratulations on completing this notebook! Here are the key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Trading costs are multifaceted:** They go beyond simple commissions and include market impact, spread costs, and opportunity costs.\n",
    "* **Liquidity is a key constraint:** The ability to trade without significantly moving the price is a major factor in the success of any quantitative strategy.\n",
    "* **Implementation Shortfall is a comprehensive measure:** It captures both the explicit and implicit costs of trading.\n",
    "* **Absorption capacity helps in strategy design:** By understanding how much of the available volume your strategy consumes, you can design portfolios that are cheaper to trade.\n",
    "* **There is a trade-off between tracking and trading:** You can reduce trading costs by allowing your portfolio to deviate from the \"ideal\" portfolio, but this introduces tracking error.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a foundational understanding of trading costs. In practice, quantitative investors use sophisticated models and algorithms to optimize their trading and minimize costs."
